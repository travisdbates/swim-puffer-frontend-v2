              <cp>
                No. Parents are not to get in the pool with their children. For
                beginner classes, parents are encouraged to sit on the deck next
                to their child to keep them both safe and comfortable.

                If your child is not potty trained, please keep him in a swim
                diaper. We also have restroom facilities in the pool area.

                Each class has 4 children in it. We do our best to keep children
                at the same age and experience level in the same class.
              </cp>

                best to accommodate both children.

              <cp>
                We do not offer extra classes for make-ups. We will, however,
                let you know if we have an opening during the day. You may
                choose to bring your child at that time for a make up.

            <Collapsible trigger="Is the pool heated?">
              <cp>
                Yes. The pool is heated to a very comfortable temperature in
                April and May. After that, the heater is no longer needed.

            <Collapsible trigger="â€‹Can my child wear a rashguard in the pool?">
              <cp>
                Yes! In fact, we think that's best. If you do need to apply
                sunscreen to your child, please do so at least 15 minutes prior
                to getting in the pool. Otherwise, it just washes right off!
                Thanks for your help in keeping our pool clean. *After 3:30, the
                entire pool is shaded and sunscreen is not needed.

                Follow the parking signs. There is a parking lot around the back
                by the pool.
